# AEP-Information-Theory
Assymetric Equipartion Law has been verified here using simulations. The code and the final paper contains the proof and analysis of theorem of typicality of sequences in information theory. The assumption is that the sequences are IIDs and are drawn from binary distribution. 

The sampling is done in an IID fashion. All the essential functions are well written in the notebook.
